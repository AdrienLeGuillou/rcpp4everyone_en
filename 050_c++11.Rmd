# C++11

C++ 11 is a standard of C++ newly established in 2011, it introduces new functionalities and notations. Compared with the previous standard, many new features have been added to make C++ even easier for beginners. This document will actively exploit these features of C++11.

** Important: Code examples in this document are written assuming that C++11 is enabled. **

## Enabling C++11


To enable C ++ 11, add the following description somewhere in your Rcpp code.

```cpp
// [[Rcpp::plugins("cpp11")]]
```

## Recommended C++11 features


### Initializer list

Initialization of variables using `{}`.

```
// Initialize Vector
// The next three are the same as c (1, 2, 3).
NumericVector v1 = NumericVector::create(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
NumericVector v2 = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
NumericVector v3   {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}; // You can omit "=".
```


### auto

Using the `auto` specifier will automatically set the type of the variable, according to the value to be assigned.

```
// variable "i" will be int
auto  i  = 4;

NumericVector v;
// variable "it" will be NumericVector::iterator
auto it = v.begin();
```


### decltype

With `decltype` you can declare variables of the same type as existing variables.

```
int i;
decltype(i) x; // variable "x" will be int
```


### Range-based for-loop

You can write a `for` statement with the same style as R.

```
IntegerVector v{1,2,3};
int sum=0;
for(auto& x : v) {
  sum += x;
}
```


### Lambda expression

You can create a function object by using lambda expression. Function object are usually used as unnamed function passed to other function.

Lambda expressions are written in the form `[](){}`.

In `[]`, you write a list of local variables you want to use in this function object.

- `[]` do not allow access to all the local variables from the function object.
- `[=]` will copy values of the all local variables to the function object.
- `[&]` enables direct access to all local variables from the function object.
- `[=x, &y]` means that the local variable "x" will be copied to the function object, and the local variable "y" is allowed to be accessed directly from the function object.

In `()`, you write arguments to be passed to this function object.

In `{}`, you describe processes you want.
  
**Return type of the lambda expression**

The return type of this function object is automatically set to the type of the returned value described in `{}`. If you want to define return type explicitly, write it like `[]()->int{}`.

**Exapmle**

The following example shows how to use lambda expression. You can find Some types of C++ code can be written in the same style as R.

*R exapmle*

``` R
v <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
A <- 2.0
res <-
  sapply(v, function(x){A*x})
```

*Rcpp exapmle*

``` cpp
// [[Rcpp::plugins("cpp11")]]
// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector rcpp_lambda_1(){
  NumericVector v = {1,2,3,4,5};
  double A = 2.0;
  NumericVector res =
    sapply(v, [&](double x){return A*x;});
  return res;
}
```
